# FlightFarePrediction
Flight Fare Prediction using relevant machine learning models.
In this flight fare prediction project, my goal was to create a predictive model that estimates flight ticket prices based on a set of relevant independent variables. I utilized data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques to achieve accurate fare predictions, contributing to the field of travel and ticket pricing. Finally I created a regressor model to predict the flight fare which has 91% accuracy.
